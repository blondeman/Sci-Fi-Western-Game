a planets civilization will be randomly generated
city generation will work in the following
at the center, a crossroads will be created
then roads will be created from each side and buildings from the side of those roads
each city will have a size value for example 100
every road created will decrement that by 1
the chance for a building to be created will be the current value / original value
this should lead to a city with dense buildings in the center, and more dispersed around the edges
